#### Design

- I wanted to use red and blue mainly in my colour scheme as they are the
colours of the club and I wanted to keep these colours prevalent.
- The image of the stadium I used on the home page was to showcase the stadium 
and also grab the users attention.
- I wanted to show the upcoming fixtures,dates,times and tv channels as it is a good way to get users to return and shows everything on one page.
- I wanted a contact page so users can get in contact with me, regarding any queries they may have.
- The club page was created to get users some information on the past of the club and also so they could see some of the clubs best moments.


#### Strategy

My aim in the design was to keep the home page simplistic with a captivating image to get fans/users attention
immediately.I also wanted the user to be able to naviagte the site very easily and have it as user-friendly as possible.

#### Scope

For users, I wanted to provide them with as much info about Munster RFC as possible.
I also wanted to add options for merchandise (through a link).I also wanted to have a contact page within my site,so a user could
get in contact with the club easily on any matter they wanted addressing. Fits with my current ability and the content is visible imediately.Plus to have social media links to be able to connect with the 
user in a different way.

#### Structure

 The main focus of the structure is to allow users to quickly get information there looking for. 
  I didnt want to have too much text as not to overwhelm the user and also keep the site tidy and flowing.
 A video to  get the users excited and have them reminiscing about the past glories.
 Users can get in contact very easily through a contact form and also through social media links in the footer.

#### Surface

The hero image on the homescreen was to showcase the stadium
the club play their matches in. The color scheme was in-line 
with the clubs colors of blue and red. I chose a white background and black text as i felt it is more readable,as i was
 going to go with a blue background first. The video was selected as I feel it gives not just one great moment but a variety of moments and could be watch numerous times.
