This is my website based on Munster Rugby Football Club.

## **UX**

## User Stories

#### 1. First Time User

- As a first time user, I want to easily find my way around the site and find what Im looking for quickly.
- As a first time user, I want to be able to check on the future fixtures of the team and see their schedule.
- I want to find information on the Munster Rugby team and also look at images/videos and read about some history on the team.
- As a fan, I want to be able to view merchandise and order/buy merchandise, or else have a link to be able to do so.
- As a First time user, I want to see if there are any links to the clubs social media channels.


#### 2. Returning User

- As a returning user, I want to check on the results of the team.
- As a returning user, I want to check on upcoming fixtures again see if the matches are being shown on television, as with covid19 I cant get to the matches.
- As a returning user, I want to see if there is any new updates about the team or club as a whole.


#### Design

- I used red and blue mainly in my colour scheme as they are the
colours of the club and I wanted to keep these colours prevalent.
- The image of the stadium I used on three pages was to showcase the stadium 
and also grab the users attention.
- The font roboto was used as i felt it mixed nicely with the background image and 
one of the attractive images.


#### Strategy

My aim in the design was to keep the home page simplistic with a captivating image to get fans/users attention
immediately.I also wanted the user to be able to naviagte the site very easily and have it as user-friendly as possible.

#### Scope

For users, I wanted to provide them with as much info about Munster RFC as possible.
I also wanted to add options for tickets (through a link).I also wanted to have a contact page within my site,so a user could
get in contact with the club easily on any matter they wanted addressing.

#### Structure

In the home page I wanted a image that would draw the attention of the user immediately. I also wanted a naviagation bar that is easily useable,
and can get you to the rest of the site without much effort.
In the history section I wanted to detail a small bit of history on the club.
I also wanted to show what the club had won and when they had won a certain competition.
In the matches section I wanted to inform the user upcoming fixtures.
Plus have a link to buy tickets for the upcoming fixtures. 
In the footer of each page i wanted to have links to the clubs social media accounts.

#### Surface

The hero image on the homescreen was to showcase the stadium
the club play their matches in. The color scheme was in-line 
with the clubs colors of blue and red. As i felt the hero image/
background image worked well I decided to use it for my fixtures and club page also,
as you can see from my wireframes I was not goin to use the image for each page.
With more time and knowledge I would of liked to have added teams crests and logos and also
information on the stadium the matches were being played at.
