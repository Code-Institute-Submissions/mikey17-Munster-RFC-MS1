#### Design

- I wanted to use red and blue mainly in my colour scheme as they are the
colours of the club and I wanted to keep these colours prevalent.
- The image of the stadium I used on the home page was to showcase the stadium 
and also grab the users attention.
- I wanted to show the upcoming fixtures,dates,times and tv channels as it is a good way to get users to return and shows everything on one page.
- I wanted a contact page so users can get in contact with me, regarding any queries they may have.
- The club page was created to get users some information on the past of the club and also so they could see some of the clubs best moments.


#### Strategy

My aim in the design was to keep the home page simplistic with a captivating image to get fans/users attention
immediately.I also wanted the user to be able to naviagte the site very easily and have it as user-friendly as possible.

#### Scope

For users, I wanted to provide them with as much info about Munster RFC as possible.
I also wanted to add options for merchandise (through a link).I also wanted to have a contact page within my site,so a user could
get in contact with the club easily on any matter they wanted addressing. Fits with my current ability and the content is visible imediately.Plus to have social media links to be able to connect with the 
user in a different way.

#### Structure

 The main focus of the structure is to allow users to quickly get information there looking for. 
  I didnt want to have too much text as not to overwhelm the user and also keep the site tidy and flowing.
 A video to  get the users excited and have them reminiscing about the past glories.
 Users can get in contact very easily through a contact form and also through social media links in the footer.

#### Surface

The hero image on the homescreen was to showcase the stadium
the club play their matches in. The color scheme was in-line 
with the clubs colors of blue and red. I chose a white background and black text as i felt it is more readable,as i was
 going to go with a blue background first. The video was selected as I feel it gives not just one great moment but a variety of moments and could be watch numerous times.

- Designed using HTML,CSS and Bootstrap 4.
- Four HTML pages used.
- Footer with icons allows for quick access to Munster's social media.

## **Testing**

- After doing my wireframes I checked to see if my nav bar and links within the nav were working correctly
- Used dev tools to check on the responsiveness of my site on all screen sizes.
- Checked to see if my social media icons in my footer were working correctly and if each icon linked correctly to the site I wanted.
- Checked my contact page to see if it worked as I wanted and checked the link in the nav to see if it brought me to the contact page as intended.
- Checked the buttons on the home page to see if they were working correctly, and also if the merchandise link opened up in a new tab.
- Test send button on the contact page to see if it worked and also the email entry input on the same page to make sure that it had to be an email address entered.
- Tested color contrasts with [a11y](https://color.a11y.com/), tests seemed good, however problem with homepage paragraph and background image.
- Used [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/), to test my HTML and tested well with just one fault with my anchor tags in my buttons on the home page.
- Used [CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), to test my css and it came back with 2 errors (Property text-decoration-skip-ink doesn't exist : none) (Property backdrop-filter doesn't exist : blur(10px)).
- Used [Spellcheck](https://www.online-spellcheck.com/), to check my readme and there was one spelling mistake which I fixed.

## **Project Bugs and Fixes**

- My table within my fixtures page is still not fully responsive and I hope to fix this issue with more knowledge, as I was told it is not ideal to use a table for this layout.
- Firstly I wanted to have the color theme completely red and blue to go with the club ethos,however these colors were too vibrant together, so I decided to use a more plain white background and black text for an easier readability.
However i used blue for headers and icons to get both colors in.
- Came accross an issue with my home page image at first with height and width problems, I went back over
a mini-project in code institue(whiskey drop) and took examples from that project to style my image and make it responsive.
- Again with my nav links I had them coloured blue but they clashed too much again, so I changed the to white within my style.css.
- Used bootstrap grid for my contact form, as at first i designed my own but the responsiveness was not right so decided to use the bootstrap contact form.
- My pictures for my tv chanels were too big at first and throwing my table reponsiveness off,so I changed the height on two of the images in my css to get them right.
- My links in the footer were white at first but i changed them to blue to get more blue into the design, and also changed the hover color to white to get them to stand out more.
- I used the bootstrap nav to make sure the user could navigate the site with ease and get back to the homepage if so required.
- I put in a link to a stote that sells Munster gear as the user can get to that store via a new tab and check the latest gear,but also not leave my site as I set it to open in a new tab.
- I used a video and some text to give the user some history on the club, but also have the option to watch past histories if they werent in the mood for reading.
- Used images of channel logos to show what channel the matches are on, as felt it was a quick and easy way for the user to get that information.
